** How to run app?

1. Make sure you got the ~docker~, ~docker-compose~ and ~yarn~ installed
2. Fill the ~env.example~ with your omdb api key
3. Run ~yarn~ to install all packages
4. Run ~docker compose up~ to start the app

** How to test app?

1. Make sure you did ~1,2,3~ from the tutorial "How to run app?"
2. Run ~yarn localtest~

** Postman collection:

I've prepared the postman collection which will definitely allow you to
check my work faster :) Feel free to use it.

/Make sure you're running the app locally. If you're not just change the API_URL variable :D/

** What did I use and why

- Docker - because it's speeds up the development time
- Postgres - because it's the great DB which allows json, and arrays in the table
- Swagger - because I did use it couple of times
- ApiCache - because I wanted to have a cache, but did not want to configure varnish
- Eslint - because I love to code with style
- Nodemon - because it's perfect demon for smooth reloading
- Sequelize - because I did not fear to learn it (it's quite nice I must say)
- Debug - because it's standard to have nice logs
